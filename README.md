# AllAboutJordan
This is a TKH assignment developing a web page for our classmate

Project Overview

This project is my attempt to bring my Figma web design to life using HTML5 and CSS3. After getting to know my classmate Jordan, I discovered that we share some similarities, which inspired me to put my best effort into creating a well-designed and meaningful webpage for him.

With the help of my lo-fi wireframe and mockup, I was able to build a personal webpage that introduces Jordan and ensures visitors get to know everything about him—his background, skills, interests, and more.

Technologies Used
	•	HTML5 for structuring the content
	•	CSS3 for styling and layout
	•	Figma for designing the initial wireframe and mockup

Project Goals
	•	Successfully translate my Figma design into a real web page
	•	Create a visually appealing site that reflects Jordan’s personality
	•	Showcase Jordan’s story, skills, and interest in an engaging way

Features
	•	About Jordan – A bio section introducing who he is
	•	Skills & Interests – Showcasing his expertise and hobbies
	•	Contact Section – Ways to connect with Jordan

Challenges & Learning

This project helped me improve my HTML5 & CSS3 skills, especially in layout design, responsiveness, and structuring content. It also reinforced the importance of understanding the person behind the page to make the design more meaningful.

Conclusion

This project is a personal and technical milestone, combining design principles with front-end development. I hope this web page does justice to Jordan’s story and provides an engaging experience for visitors.
